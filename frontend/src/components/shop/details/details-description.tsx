                A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort
                the human foot. Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and
                fashion.The design of shoes has varied enormously through time
                and from culture to culture, with form originally being tied to
                function. Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and
                climate conditions, it is still vulnerable to environmental
                hazards such as sharp rocks.!
